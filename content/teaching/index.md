        The teaching of the software engineering group includes Introduction to Programming, Software Engineering, Formal Methods, Generative Software Engineering. Many of the teaching is research led and exposes students to current topics and challenges in industry and academia.

        Every semester we offer group projects (12 credits) where you can apply your knowledge and explore the software engineering of complex systems.

        We are also supervising BSc and MSc thesis. For a list of topics, please see our thesis topics on [Moodle](https://moodle.uni-weimar.de/course/view.php?id=46874).
