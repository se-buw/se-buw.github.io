The teaching of the software engineering group includes lectures from introduction to programming, to general software engineering, to specializations in advanced topics of software engineering. Many of the teaching is research led and exposes students to current topics and challenges in industry and academia.

Every semester we offer group projects (12 credits) where you can apply your knowledge and explore the software engineering of complex systems.

We are also supervising BSc and MSc thesis. For a list of topics, see below.
