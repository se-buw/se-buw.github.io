It is not obvious how to set an empty string as a default value for an EMF string attribute. To set an empty string as default value do the following.

-   Select the Attribute
-   In the Property View click into the value field of \"Default Value Literal\"
-   Do not enter something.

To remove this empty value again, click \"Restore Default Value\" in the toolbar.
