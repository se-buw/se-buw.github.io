EMF can generate plug-ins which provide wizards for creating new model instances and an editor which allows you to enter your model information.

The following assumes that you have already have knowledge in developing Eclipse plug-ins. For more information about Eclipse plug-in development please see [Eclipse Plugin Tutorial](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipsePlugin/article.html)

## 5.1. Generating edit / editor code

Eclipse EMF allow you to create a editor for your model. Select your *.genmodel* file, right-click on it and select **Generate Edit Code** and afterwards **Generate Editor Code**.

Two Eclipse plugin projects have been created, "de.vogella.emf.webpage.model.edit" and "de.vogella.emf.webpage.model.editor".

## 5.2. Run your plugins

Select the __*.editor__ project and start a new Eclipse instance with your new plug-in via right mouse-click on it and by selecting **Run-As** > **Eclipse application**.

This should start a new Eclipse runtime instance. If you cannot see this entry in the menu, you will need to install *Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment*.

## 5.3. Create your model

In new Eclipse instance create a new project of type *General* called *testing* and a folder called *website*.

Select this folder, right click on it, select **New** > **Other...​** > **Example EMF Model Creation Wizards** > **Webpage Model**.
