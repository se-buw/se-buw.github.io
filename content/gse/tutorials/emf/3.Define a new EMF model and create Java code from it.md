## 3.1. Project and initial model creation

- Create a new project called ``de.vogella.emf.webpage.model`` via **File** > **New  Project...​** > **Ecore Modeling Project**.

- This should open a visual editor for creating EMF models.

- Open the *Properties* view via the menu **Window** > **Show View** > **Other...​** > **Properties**. This view allows you to modify the attributes of your model elements.

- Click on *Class* and click into the editor to create a new class. Create the ``Web``, ``Webpage``, ``Category`` and `Article` EClasses.

- Use the *Attribute* node to add the attribute called *name* to each class. This attribute should have the `EString` type. You can set the name under **Properties \> Semantic \> Name** and the type under **Properties \> Semantic \> EType.**

- Add the *title*, *description* and *keywords* attributes to the *Web* and *Webpage* model elements.

- We want to use the data type calendar in our model. Select ``Datatype`` and drag it into your model. Assign the name *Calendar* to it. Use ``java.util.Calendar`` as type parameter.

- Add a new Attribute called *created* to ``Article`` and use your new type.

- Under Relation select either Reference or Composition and create an arrow similar to the next picture.

- Make sure the upper bound is set to \"-1\" (\* on the user interface) and that the ``Containment`` property is selected. In case ``Containment`` is not selected, you will not be able to add children to ``Web`` in the editor.

- Create these compositions from Web to Webpage, from Webpage to Category, and from Category to Article.

## 3.2. View Ecore diagram

- Close the diagram and open the *webpage.ecore* file. The result should look like the following screenshot.

## 3.3. Set the package

- Open the *webpage.genmodel* and select the *Webpage* node. Set the base package property to ``de.vogella.emf.webpage.model``.
